The example can be found in the **RestFrames** package at

    examples/examplee_X2X2_to_ZllXHggX.C

You can run the compiled example executable:

    ./examples/examplee_X2X2_to_ZllXHggX.x

or run the example from the ROOT interactive command line:

	root [0] .x examples/examplee_X2X2_to_ZllXHggX.C++

For the latter, if **RestFrames** is not installed in an area in the default `PATH` then you must first load the **RestFrames** environmental variables with `source setup_RestFrames.(c)sh`.
